# Contributing

This constitution is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to file issues and submit pull requests.

## How to Contribute

The preferred way to contribute is to submit a Pull Request. A Pull Request is a way to make your modification appear on GitHub in a format that encourages discussion and makes the modification easy to incorporate into the draft document.

The easiest way to do a pull request is to go to the [constitution file](https://github.com/thiesa/thiesa/blob/master/constitution.md) and then press the [pencil icon](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

## What to put in a pull request

Keep your pull request as small as possible. You want the change to be about one topic, usually just one line. If you want to make several different changes, open separate pull requests. It's more work, but this makes it a lot easier for people to review and discuss your changes, and gives you a better chance of having your changes incorporated in the constitution.

If you want to fix a series of typos, you can submit a pull request that incorporates all of your typo changes in the document.

## Adding a line

If you want to add a new, numbered line to the constitution, add it as the last item of the relevant section. This way you won't have to re-number all the other items, which would make it very hard to review the change. Don't worry if the change would make more sense next to a higher-up item. That will be fixed after all the changes are discussed.

## Removing a line

If you removed a line, please renumber all subsequent items in the current section (if any). Make sure you fix any references to the item you deleted and also to all renumbered items.

## Submit an issue

If you'd like to bring up a more general discussion that can't be expressed by a small document change, you can submit a GitHub issue. Here too, keep this to a single topic, and make it short and sweet.
